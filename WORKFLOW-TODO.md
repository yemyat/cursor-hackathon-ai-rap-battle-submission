# Workflow Implementation Status

## Completed âœ…
- Created battle workflow structure
- Added workflow helper functions to rapBattle.ts
- Simplified rap agent to support lyrics-only mode
- Created startBattleWorkflow wrapper

## Remaining Tasks ðŸš§

1. **Fix workflow invocation** - Need to properly wire up workflow.start() call from joinBattle
2. **Test workflow execution** - Ensure turns execute in sequence
3. **Remove old orchestration code** - Clean up executeRound, submitInstructions flow
4. **Add workflow status tracking** - Show workflow progress in UI
5. **Handle workflow errors** - Add onComplete handler for error cases
6. **Test synchronized playback** - Ensure timing still works with workflow

## Key Files Modified
- `/convex/workflows/battleWorkflow.ts` - Main workflow orchestrator
- `/convex/rapBattle.ts` - Added workflow helper functions
- `/convex/agents/rapAgent.ts` - Added includeMusicTool parameter
- `/convex/startBattleWorkflow.ts` - Workflow starter

## Notes
- Workflow uses runAfter for turn timeouts
- Lyrics generation separated from music generation
- Each turn: wait â†’ generate lyrics â†’ create plan â†’ generate music â†’ sync playback â†’ wait for complete
- Workflow automatically progresses through 3 rounds

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create battle
- [ ] Join battle (should start workflow)
- [ ] Submit instructions within 10s
- [ ] Verify lyrics generation
- [ ] Verify music generation
- [ ] Verify synchronized playback
- [ ] Verify auto-advance to next turn
- [ ] Verify round progression
- [ ] Verify battle completion after 3 rounds
